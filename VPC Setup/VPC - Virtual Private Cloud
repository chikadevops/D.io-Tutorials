What is VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway?

You can Imagine you're building a virtual spacé for the company GatoGrowFast.com's so that the computers can communicate securely. That's what VPC, or Virtual Private Cloud, is all about. It's like creating a private room in the cloud just for GatoGrowFast.com's use.

Here's an example: Think of GatoGrowFast.com's office building. Inside, there are different departments like HR, Finance, and IT. Each department has its own area with specific access rules. Similarly, in a VPC, GatoGrowFast.com can create different sections, called subnets, for different parts of the business.

Now, let's say GatoGrowFast.com wants to connect its office to the internet. They'd use a router to control the flow of data in and out of the building. In a VPC, GatoGrowFast.com has something similar called an Internet Gateway. It lets their VPC communicate with the internet securely.

NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway as a secret agent between GatoGrowFast.com's computers and the internet. When a computer inside their virtual office wants to talk to the internet, the NAT Gateway steps in. It translates the computer's message and sends it out, but it hides who sent it. It's like sending a letter without your return address. This way, the internet only sees the NAT Gateway's address, keeping GatoGrowFast.com's computers safe and anonymous online.

Note- A router is a device that directs data packets between computer networks. Think of it as a traffic cop for the internet. When data is sent from one device to another across a network, it's broken down into smaller packets. These packets need to find their way to the correct destination, and that's where the router comes in.

Imagine you're sending a letter to a friend across the country. You drop it in a mailbox, and it's picked up by a postal worker. The postal worker knows which roads to take and which sorting centers to pass through to ensure your letter reaches its destination. Similarly, a router knows how to send data packets from your device to the right destination on the internet. Routers use routing tables, which are like maps of the internet, to determine the best path for data packets to take. They analyze information in the packets, such as destination IP addresses, to make these decisions. Once the packets reach their destination, the router ensures they're delivered to the correct device.

What is an IP address?

An IP address is like a phone number for your computer. It's a unique set of numbers that helps computers find and talk to each other on a network, like the internet.

There are two main types of IP addresses: public IP addresses and private IP addresses. However, each type has different versions, with IPv4 and IPvo being the most common.

Public IP Address: This is like your home address. It's unique and helps other computers on the internet find yours. Just like how people send letters to your house using your address, data packets are sent to your computer using its public IP address.

* A public IP address is globally unique and is assigned by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to a device connected to the internet.
* It allows devices to communicate with other devices across the internet.
* Public IP addresses can be either dynamic or static. Dynamic IPs change periodically, often each time a device reconnects to the internet, while static IPs remain constant. Static IPs are typically used for servers, remote access, or services that require consistent connectivity.

Private IP Address: Think of this like an internal extension number in a big office building. It's used for communication within a specific network, like your home Wi-Fi network or an office network. Devices within the same network can talk to each other using their private IP addresses, but these addresses aren't visible to the outside world.

* Private IP addresses are typically assigned by a router or a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server within the network.
* Devices within the same private network communicate with each other using their private IP addresses.
* These addresses are not routable over the internet. They are used for internal network communication only and are hidden from the outside world.
* It is not globally unique and can be reused within different private networks without conflict.

IPv4 Address:

* IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) addresses are the most common type of IP addresses used today.
* They are 32-bit numeric addresses written in decimal format, separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
* IPv4 addresses are divided into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E, with classes A, B, and C being used for addressing hosts on networks.
* Each octet in an IPv4 address can have a value between 0 and 255. This is because each octet is made up of eight bits, and the maximum value that can be represented with eight bits is 255 (which is 11111111 in binary).

Pv6 Address:

* IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) addresses are designed to replace IPv due to the exhaustion of available IPv4 addresses.

IPvo addresses are 128-bit hexadecimal addresses, represented in eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e: 037,0:7334).
IPv6 addresses provide a much larger address space compared to IPv4, allowing for a virtually unlimited number of unique addresses.
What is CIDR?

CIDR, or Classless Inter-Domain Routing, makes it easier to talk about groups of IP addresses on the internet. Instead of naming each address one by one, CIDR uses a simple shortcut. It's like saying "All the houses on Main Street" instead of listing each house separately.

For example, let's say you have the IP address 192.168.1.0. With CIDR notation, you might write it like this:
192.168.1.0/24. The "/24" part tells us that we're talking about all the houses on that street from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255.

So, CIDR helps us manage and organize IP addresses on the internet in a way that's easy to understand and work with. It's like having a shorthand for talking about big groups of addresses.

Determining the number of available IP addresses in a CIDR block To determine the number of available IP addresses in a CIDR block, you calculate it using the formula:
